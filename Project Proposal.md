For my project, I would like to look into police misconduct data aggregated by the Mapping Police Violence Project. This data file contains 3 different datasets (X,Y, and Z) accounting for a large portion of the deaths in police custody between the years 2013 and 2015. This data tells us the name, location (city,state,zip, and address in most cases) of deaths in police custody as well as a number of facts about the death and its consequences. These facts include the cause of death, the official disposition (justified, unreported, etc), whether charges were filed against the officer, whether the victim had any symptoms of mental illness, and whether the victim was reported armed. Another interesting aspect of the data that may be useful with a good bit of scraping is that these data points also include a link to a news article associated with each death.

A interesting question Iâ€™d like to answer first would be whether symptoms of mental illness determine the likelihood of a case being deemed justified. It may also be interesting to compare that to how a person being reported armed affects the official disposition. While I have not yet determined how exactly to use the information, I think I may be able to somehow incorporate the location, given how granular the data is in this area.
